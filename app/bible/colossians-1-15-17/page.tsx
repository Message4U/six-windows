        <p className="p" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
  Colossians 1:15–17 reveals that Jesus is not only Savior, but Creator. He is the
  visible image of the invisible God, and everything in existence was made through
  Him and for Him. This includes what we see and what we cannot see. Christ is also
  the One who holds creation together—nothing continues apart from His sustaining power.

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 0 }}>Why this matters for the whole story</h2>
       <p className="p" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
  These verses expand the Bible’s story by showing that creation is centered on Christ.
  The same One who redeems is the One who created all things. That means redemption
  is not God’s backup plan—it is the restoration of what belongs to Jesus. The whole
  story of Scripture points to Him as Creator, Sustainer, and King over everything.

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 0 }}>Bring it into real life</h2>
        <p className="p" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
  If Jesus holds all things together, then your life is not held together by your
  strength alone. Every breath, every moment, every part of reality depends on Him.
  This means you can trust Him not only for salvation, but for stability, purpose,
  and direction. Following Christ is not adding religion to life—it is aligning with
  the One who sustains everything.
