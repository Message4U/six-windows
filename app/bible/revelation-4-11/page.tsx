        <p className="p" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
  Revelation 4:11 is a declaration of worship in heaven. It shows God as fully worthy
  of glory, honor, and power because He is the Creator of all things. Everything that
  exists is not accidental—it exists because God willed it into being. This verse
  connects creation with worship: God deserves praise not only for what He does, but
  for who He is as the One who gives all life its origin and purpose.

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 0 }}>Why this matters for the whole story</h2>
        <p className="p" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
  Revelation 4:11 reminds us that the entire biblical story leads toward worship.
  Creation is not just the starting point of Scripture—it is the foundation for why
  God deserves everything. If all things were made for His pleasure, then human life,
  history, and redemption are not centered on us, but on Him. The Bible moves toward
  a restored world where God is recognized as worthy, and every created thing returns
  to the purpose it was made for: His glory.

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 0 }}>Bring it into real life</h2>
        <p className="p" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
  If you were created for God’s pleasure, then your life is not ultimately about
  self-definition or personal achievement. Your purpose is rooted in something
  higher: worship, obedience, and delight in the One who made you. This verse invites
  you to see daily life differently—not as something random, but as something meant
  to reflect God’s worth. Even ordinary choices can become acts of worship when they
  are lived for the Creator instead of the self.
