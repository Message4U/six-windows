              “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 0 }}>What this verse is saying</h2>
        <p className="p" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
          This opening verse of the Bible establishes God as eternal and sovereign. God does not emerge from
          creation—He exists before it. Everything that is created has a beginning; God does not. By placing
          God before all things, Scripture declares that reality itself depends on Him. Creation is not an
          extension of God, nor a random event, but the deliberate act of a personal, all-powerful Creator
          who brings everything into existence by His will.

      <div className="card" style={{ marginTop: 14 }}>
        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 0 }}>Why this matters for the whole story</h2>
        <p className="p" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
          Genesis 1:1 does more than describe how the world began—it defines how the entire biblical story works.
          If God is the Creator, then He is also the rightful source of meaning, order, and authority over what He
          has made. Creation belongs to Him, depends on Him, and exists for His purposes. Every other question the
          Bible addresses—about human identity, brokenness, justice, redemption, and hope—rests on this truth.
          Without a Creator, there is no shared starting point; with a Creator, the story has direction.

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 0 }}>Bring it into real life</h2>
        <p className="p" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
          If God created the world intentionally, then life is not something you simply manage or survive—it is
          something you receive and steward. Your time, your body, your abilities, and your relationships are not
          random possessions but part of a created reality that began before you. This changes how decisions are
          made. Instead of asking only, “What do I want?” a deeper question emerges: “What was this life given to
          me for?” Creation invites responsibility, not as pressure, but as meaning.
