      <h1>CREATION</h1>

      <p>
  The Bible begins with a clear and foundational claim: God created the world, and He did so intentionally.
  Life is not self-made, random, or directionless—it exists because God chose to give it life.
  Before choices, failures, questions, or beliefs, there is a Creator who brings meaning to life by creating it with purpose.
  You may still be exploring what you believe, but this journey starts here—with the understanding that the world
  and human life are designed, not accidental. From this starting point, everything else in the story begins to make sense.
