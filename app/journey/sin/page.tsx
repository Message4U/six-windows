  <p>
  Sin is not simply about making bad choices or breaking moral rules—it is about direction and trust.
  When humanity chose to live independently from God, something deeper than behavior was affected.
  Trust was replaced with self-reliance, and God’s design was exchanged for personal control.
  Even when life appears normal, successful, or well-intentioned, living apart from God slowly
  reshapes how we see ourselves, others, and the world. Sin distorts what was created good,
  not because God failed, but because trust was broken.
